homeless-helper
===============

Open Source Services Locator App -- see [homelesshelper.us](http://homelesshelper.us/).

This application is currently written to use the now-deprecated
OpenHMIS API v1; see the [OpenHMIS API
documentation](https://github.com/PCNI/OpenHMIS/blob/master/API.md)
for details.

To serve Homeless Helper clients in the meantime, there is a server
running the v1 API at
[open-ciss.appspot.com](http://open-ciss.appspot.com/) (using Google
App Engine / CloudSQL).
